# Introduction
This repository contains the Python modules the Kourion Amathous Gate Cemetery Project (KAGC) used to analyze its stratigraphy for the site's final publication[^1]. As a legacy project, the publication team faced several challenges[^2]. These included, among others, figuring out the best way to harmonize the multiple recording systems used during the project's field phase and incompletely processed artifact databases[^3]. This document outlines the KAGC's approach to dealing with legacy archaeological datasets and how we leveraged the power of Python and Ipython Notebooks to prepare our data for publication.
